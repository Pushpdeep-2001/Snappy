# Snappy - Chat Application 
Snappy is an innovative chat application built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This tech stack provides a robust and scalable foundation for developing modern web applications.

At its core, Snappy leverages MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing chat messages and user data. MongoDB's flexibility allows Snappy to efficiently handle large volumes of data and adapt to evolving user needs.

Express.js serves as the backend framework for Snappy, enabling the creation of RESTful APIs for handling user authentication, message routing, and other backend functionalities. Its lightweight and minimalist approach make it an ideal choice for building scalable web applications.

On the frontend, Snappy utilizes React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture facilitates the development of interactive and responsive UI components, enhancing the user experience of the chat application.

Node.js powers the server-side logic of Snappy, enabling real-time communication between clients and the server through WebSocket technology. Node.js's event-driven architecture ensures high performance and responsiveness, making it well-suited for building real-time applications like Snappy.
